This is not just a plugin, it's a fork and adaptation of the Matt Mullenweg Hello Dolly plugin but using the lyrics to Warren G's song Regulate. That makes it, maybe, not just a plugin, but the symbol of an entire new generation, summarized in Warren G's immortal question: Damn what's next?

This is not just a plugin, it's a fork and adaptation of the Matt Mullenweg Hello Dolly plugin but using the lyrics to Warren G's song Regulate (featureing Nate Dogg). That makes it, maybe, not just a plugin, but the symbol of an entire new generation, summarized in Warren G's immortal question: damn what's next? When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Regulate</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.
